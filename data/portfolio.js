    bio: `I build systems that don't just work—they excel. With 3+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML, I specialize in architecting scalable pipelines, optimizing algorithms, and bringing generative AI into production. My passion lies in solving complex problems through intelligent automation and data-driven insights.

From semantic search systems to multi-agent AI architectures, I've delivered production-grade solutions that consistently achieve 60-80% performance improvements. I'm driven by the intersection of innovation and pragmatism—building systems that are not only cutting-edge but also maintainable and scalable.

Currently focused on generative AI, MLOps, and cloud-native architectures, I'm always exploring the next frontier in machine learning.`,
